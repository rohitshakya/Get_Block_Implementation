<center><h1> Buffer cache and Get Block Simulation </h1></center>

<br>

Academic project to implement Getblk. We are aiming to simulate buffer management in UNIX system. This project was my first application in Msc in Operating System. By developing this project I assimilate and learnt about:  
* Scenarios of retrieval of buffer.
* Structure of the buffer pool and buffer header.
* Algorithms for Reading and writing disk blocks.
* Working in Multiprocessing environment of a computer application.
* January 2020 - March 2020
