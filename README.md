<center><h1> Buffer cache and Get Block Simulation </h1></center>

<br>

Academic project to implement Getblk. We are aiming to simulate buffer management in UNIX system. This project was my first application in Msc in Operating System. By developing this project I assimilate and learnt about:
          * Scenarios of retrieval of buffer.
          * Structure of the buffer pool and buffer header.
          * Algorithms for Reading and writing disk blocks.
          * Working in Multiprocessing environment of a computer application.</p>
